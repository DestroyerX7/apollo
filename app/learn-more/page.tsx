            My name is Blake Ojera, the senior developer behind Apollo. It has
            been a pleasure to be apart of this ground breaking work that we
            have been able to do.

          <p>
            I&apos;m a computer science student at CU Boulder with a strong
            interest in technology and problem-solving. I enjoy building and
            experimenting with software projects â€” right now, I&apos;m working
            on a 2D game in Unity and a web app that integrates the Spotify Web
            Playback SDK. Outside of programming, I like staying active and
            challenging myself at the gym; one of my current fitness goals is to
            increase my bench press to 225 pounds. I also enjoy exploring new
            FPS games, and learning about how emerging technologies like AI are
            shaping the world around us.
